                    Think of NFTs as the Pokemon Trading Card Game for anyone who loves collecting. NFTs are currently trending. Now is the time to join the community!
                    NFTs fundamentally changed how people can collect and trade art.<br/><br/>

                    As for why PokePunkz Club? Well, maybe you want a PokePunk because you're craving that nostalgia that normal life cant supply anymore.  
                    Or maybe you want a PokePunk to match the inner Punk you are. But mostly PokePunkz are very rare, so beautifully designed that you can't go wrong.  
                    PokePunkz Art will never go out of style. It is in the eyes of the beholder, and you know you want to bring out that 90s kid inside you.  
                    Join the PokePunk Club while its still early!
