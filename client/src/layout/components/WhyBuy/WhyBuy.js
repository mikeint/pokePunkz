                    Think of NFTs as the Pokemon Trading Card Game for anyone who loves collecting. PokePunkz are not only a collectable,
                    they can turn into unique coins that you always have in your pocket. These coins will be ready for battle. When you are chilling in the
                    metaverse, face off against your friends or other PokePunkz. 
                    Each PokeCoin will receive stats based off their PokeHat they are wearing. Stats will be viewable on the website.

                    Maybe you want a PokePunk because you're craving that nostalgia that normal life cant supply anymore.  
                    Or maybe you want a PokePunk to match the inner Punk in you. But mostly PokePunkz are very rare, so beautifully designed that you can't go wrong.
                    Oh and I should mention the Holographics, those are very cool. 151 unique Holographics in the collection, join now to be part giveaways and future content.
