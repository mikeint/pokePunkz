                NF Terrestrials have been scattered across all corners of the Metaverse, cast out and teleported by 
                rivals inside the Intergalactic Federation government. The NF Terrestrial Supercarrier glides silently
                through the endless darkness of space, searching for the lost council members. Finding them can restore
                balance to the Metaverse, or plunge it into a vast civil war fought across star systems and galaxies.
                Discover the exiled NF Terrestrials. The future of the Metaverse is in your hands.
